Numerical analysis of the Riemann–von Mangoldt formula and finite-range polynomial corrections.
# Numerical Consistency of the Riemann–von Mangoldt Formula

This repository contains a numerical analysis of the non-trivial zeros
of the Riemann zeta function.

We examine the Riemann–von Mangoldt leading term, introduce a minimal
finite-range polynomial correction, and show via extrapolation
(zeros 501–700) that such corrections are local and non-universal.

Conclusion:
Only the Riemann–von Mangoldt leading term is universal; residual
fluctuations are structureless.

This repository provides the manuscript and minimal reproducibility
notes.
